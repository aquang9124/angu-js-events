A web app built using the MEAN stack. The original functionality is hidden away because the API I was working with was not returning enough data. To compensate, I created a new feature where if you put in your address it will show you a graph of all the police-involved killings in the past year based on data from the Counted API. The original functionality can still be accessed by clicking on the header. :3
